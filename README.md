# SAP Datasphere and Analytics Cloud Project - Sales Analysis

## Project Background
The aim of this project was mostly to test the waters of SAP Datasphere and SAP Analytics Cloud. However, while testing these waters, I wanted to solve a typical problem for a sample business.

### Problem Statement
The sales team of Nancy9ice & Co group is dealing with a major problem of having data scattered across different files, making it hard to get a clear picture of what’s really going on. Without a simple way to track sales performance, it’s tough to spot trends, figure out what’s working, and fix what’s not.

### Project Objectives
This project is about making life easier for the sales team by pulling all that messy data together using Datasphere and creating a clean, easy-to-use Sales Dashboard in SAP Analytics Cloud. The goal is to give everyone view of key sales metrics like revenue, regional performance, and top-selling customers. With this dashboard, the team can make smarter decisions and focus on what matters.

## Approach to the Project
This project solves the problem of this business using the following steps:

### Data Ingestion
Three csv files named customers, orders, and stores were imported as tables using the SAP Datasphere Data Builder. After the import, these tables were now available in Datasphere.

### Data Transformation
The major transformations involved:

- Derivation of a new column, 'order_date_id', from the conversion of order_date column to string and 'Currency Code' using Datasphere SQL view. This will enable modeling to the Date_Time_Dimensions view. This resulted in a new view called 'orders view'

- Derivation of the Date_Time_Dimensions view from the existing dimensions table generated by Datasphere.

The sql queries for these transformations are found in [this folder](./sql%20queries/)

### ERD Model Design

An Entity-Relationship Diagram model was designed to establish relationships between the entities while defining the 'orders view' as a fact table while the 'customers', 'stores', and 'Date_Time_Dimensions' were defined as dimensions creating a Star-Schema kind of modeling.

Defining the 'orders view' as a Fact table was important to create the Analytical Model that's needed to be consumed by the SAP Analytics Cloud for dashboarding.

### Creating the Analytical Model

The Analytical Model was created to enable data consumption by SAP Analytics Cloud. Connecting the SAP Analytics Cloud to my Datasphere account made the analytical model visible for use.

The Analytical Model comprised of measures (numerical metrics) and dimensions (attributes) that enabled analysis. Here's a screenshot of the dimensions and measures in the model.

### Building the Dashboard

To enable the sales team, a dashboard was built to track the following overtime:

- Total net revenue after tax

- Total active customers

- Total Orders

- Net revenue by store locations

- Top customers based on amount spent

- Total net revenue by Year-Month

Filters were also added to enable the sales team narrow down the numbers based on certain periods.

By the end of this project, the sales team now has a dashboard to rely on to make decisions.
